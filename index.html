  This page is for Barry Cipra and Peter Winkler, and anyone else
  who is interested. For an explanation of the tiles, read
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05718"> this here</a>.<br>

  These tori are formed using the 7040 4x4 magic squares on the labels
  of the tiles. You may claim that there are only 880 magic squares,
  but in this set of tiles, orientation matters, so if you "rotate" the
  magic square, you get a new one.  However, it's true that there are many
  symmetries, but it's more subtle.  So even though there probably only 880
  truly unique diagrams, it's not that easy to filter out the duplicates.
  Enjoy!
